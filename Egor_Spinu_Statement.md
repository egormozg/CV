# Introduction for Ariel University

## Objective

My name is Egor Spinu, and my goal is to enroll in the B.Sc. in Mathematics and Computer Science program at Ariel University. My path to this decision has been unconventional, driven by a deep-seated need to understand the fundamental principles of the systems around me. Having spent my career building complex systems in the practical world—from engineering to AI-powered software—I am now seeking the rigorous academic foundation that only a formal degree can provide. I believe this program is the essential next step to help me innovate in the AI era and continue building my startup, Gifokamp.

## My Journey: From Practical Application to Theoretical Pursuit

My career didn't start in a classroom. At 20, I left my initial studies in innovation engineering to work full-time installing heating systems. It was a practical decision born of necessity, but it taught me invaluable lessons about real-world systems and problem-solving.

This hands-on experience led me to co-found **Logoritm Corp SRL** (2015-2018), a firm that provided construction and heating engineering services. The company is now passive as my partner moved to Russia, but during its active years, I was responsible for everything from technical oversight to client management. As a final venture with the firm, I single-handedly organized a magician's concert at the National Philharmonic on April 1st, 2017. I spotted the opportunity and handled all aspects: negotiating the venue, designing the promotion, managing ticket sales, and overseeing logistics to ensure a sold-out show. It was a testament to my ability to execute complex projects from start to finish.

Later, I pursued studies in psychopedagogy, but I found my self-study outpaced the university curriculum. I completed an intensive 200-hour certification in Ericksonian Hypnotherapy, which gave me a deeper insight into cognitive structures than the formal courses. This pattern has defined my life: learning by doing, and always seeking a deeper level of understanding.

These experiences, along with personal life events, have given me a unique perspective and a resilient, determined character.

## Current Focus: Gifokamp - An AI Language Learning Ecosystem

I am currently dedicating my full attention to developing **Gifokamp**, a high-tech startup aimed at revolutionizing language acquisition. It is a complete ecosystem I have been architecting and building, which consists of two main parts:

1.  **The Gifokamp Web App:** This is the core platform where users master vocabulary. It's built on a modern tech stack and features:
    *   **Custom Visual Playlists:** Transforming word lists into dynamic, image-rich playlists using user-uploaded photos, GIFs, or AI-generated visuals.
    *   **AI Pronunciation Coaching:** Immediate, actionable feedback on pronunciation.
    *   **Spaced Repetition System (SRS):** A scientifically-backed algorithm to ensure vocabulary moves into long-term memory.

2.  **The AI Language Clipper (Chrome Extension):** This is the intelligent "field agent" for learning.
    *   **Context-Aware Translation:** It uses Google's Gemini AI to analyze the surrounding text, providing translations that fit the precise context of what the user is reading.
    *   **Seamless Integration:** It connects directly to the user's Gifokamp account, saving new words and phrases to their learning playlists.

Developing Gifokamp has solidified my desire to study mathematics and computer science. While I can build the application, I want to master the theories behind the AI, the algorithms, and the computational models I am using.

## Other Achievements

### Memory Championships

To push my cognitive abilities, I have competed in international memory sports:
*   **Asia Open Memory Championship (Bali, 2019):** Ranked 90th out of ~170 competitors.
*   **2nd Korea OPEN Memory Championship (2018):** Ranked 122nd out of ~150 competitors.

This pursuit was not just a hobby, but a practical exploration of learning and data retention, principles I am now building into Gifokamp.
